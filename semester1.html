        <h2>About the Text</h2>
        <p>
            An Astrologer’s Day is a short story by R. K. Narayan that explores themes of fate, coincidence, irony, guilt, and human psychology. The story revolves around an astrologer who earns his living not through real astrological knowledge but through clever observation and experience. Set in a busy marketplace, the narrative takes a dramatic turn when the astrologer encounters a stranger who turns out to be a man from his violent past. Through this unexpected meeting, Narayan highlights how past actions resurface in surprising ways. The story also subtly criticizes blind faith in astrology while portraying the resilience and intelligence of common people. The ending brings a sense of relief and irony, making the story both engaging and thought-provoking.
